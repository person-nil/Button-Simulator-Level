**Button Simulator Level**

A Basic Incremental

Either go to the repository on GitHub Pages (https://person-nil.github.io/Button-Simulator-Level/)

OR 

copy `index.html` and use a html editor to run the code

Very simple and easy unlike most github stuff, for now at least

Also by "for now" i mean like after 2 updates, when i have to divide the code up into smaller files, but who cares, everyone who's not a coding nerd (like me) will prob just go on GitHub Pages
